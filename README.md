A small platform game, by Alejandro Santos, ale@ralo.com.ar. This project got featured on [Reddit Programming](http://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/1usjl5/because_reinventing_the_wheel_several_times_is/), thanks for all the comments!!

Because reinventing the wheel several times is the best way to learn about wheels.

This is a research project about the creation of the same game in different programming languages. So far I've done this game in:

* Python, using PyGame
* C, using SDL 1.2
* Java, using native Swing and Java2D
* C++, using SDL2.
